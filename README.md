This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You will need Node.js 10.13 or later. If you don't, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once that is complete, run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mcampopiano/ample-star-wars.git
cd ample-star-wars
npm install
```
### Running the development server:
In the terminal, run the command:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
The application is now being served to localhost at port 3000. Navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser,
and enjoy the app! Thanks for taking the time to check it out.
